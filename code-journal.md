* For HTML i used jessica's github repo `tailwind-activity-template`.

* For tailwind setup i followed step-by-step installation setup on [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

* Even though i followed the steps i couldn't get it to work properly because it didn't download correctly.

* Maryam showed me the simple way by directing it into my folder in VS code.

* After that i was able to add couple styles from tailwindcss when randomly the styles stopped applying

* And when i tried to add `tailwindcss` the style did not apply.

* After trying couple styles to see if it would work, i asked for help in slack.

* After couple minutes Maryam suggested i should try `npm run build`.

* After i tried that, it started working and styles applied accordingly.
